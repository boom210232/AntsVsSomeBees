# Ant-vs-some-Bee
Ant vs some Bee is a single player tower defense game. As the ant queen, you populate your colony with the bravest ants you can muster. Your ants must protect their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory. Irritate the bees enough by throwing leaves at them, and they will be vanquished. Fail to pester the airborne intruders adequately, and your queen will succumb to the bees' wrath. This game is inspired by PopCap Games [Plants Vs. Zombies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies)

By letting the player deploy an ant to an empty cell to defend the ant queen from a bee. Each ant has its own special power such as WallAnt use for defense only. Players need to go through each wave to complete that stage(3 stages).
